# Breast Cancer Classification

In this project, 3 different datasets were used to train the machine learning models in the diagnosis and classification of breast cancer.
The datasets are the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic (WBCD), Wisconsin Breast Cancer Original (WBCO) and Breast Cancer Coimbra (BCC) datasets.
The machine learning models that were built are the SVM models and ANN model.

The machine learning models were first trained with the original datasets, then principle component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were applied to the datasets to reduced the dimensionality of the datasets. 
After that the machine learning models were trained with the PCA- and LDA-reduced datasets.
